# Python-Workshop-Code
Here stores the coding files from a Python workshop "資料科學家的工作日常" Basic II. For HW2 - HW5 are the code solving problems, and HW7 - HW9 are some basic applications using Python (Web-crawling and string post-processing). There are no HW1, HW6 and HW10 because there are no assignments. Below are the word details for each code files:

* 作業二 (HW 2): Substring replaced and combination of multiple dictionaries problems.
* 作業三 (HW 3): Two Sums (Leetcode Problem # 1) and Self-dividing Numbers (Leetcode Problem # 728)
* 作業四 (HW 4): String location and handcrafted "map" function problems.
* 作業五 (HW 5): All possible string permutations (similar to Leetcode Problem # 46) and Climbing Stairs (Leetcode Problem # 70)
* 作業七 (HW 7): Using "requests" module to collect masks information and do some simple statistics.
* 作業八 (HW 8): Continue the work in 作業七 (HW 7) and push the results to a database ("sqlite3" module).
* 作業九 (HW 9): Using "BeautifulSoup" module to collect the news online and count the frequency of the words.
