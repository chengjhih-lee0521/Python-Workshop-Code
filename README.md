# Python-Workshop-Code
Here stores the coding files from a Python workshop "資料科學家的工作日常" Basic I. Below are the word explanation for each code files (exclude the questions-answers problem) and the files are updated from my local computer:

* 作業一 (HW 1): HW 1 includes the basic practice about Python codes, such as printing out "Hello World!".
* 作業二 (HW 2): HW 2 includes the practices about integers and floats. The coding problems are the sum of two integers and the interchangement of two variables.
* 作業三 (HW 3): HW 3 includes the practices about strings. The coding problems are string replacement and splitting out the main part of a website.
* 作業四 (HW 4): HW 4 is about the basic container in Python (list, tuple). The coding problems are switching the elements of a list.
* 作業五 (HW 5): HW 5 is about the advance container in Python (dictionary). The coding problems are combining dictionaries and removing the repeated elements of a list.
* 作業七 (HW 7): HW 7 is about the process control such as loop and if-else. The coding problems are the calculation of factorial number and discriminating the odd and even numbers of a llist.
* 作業八 (HW 8): HW 8 is about the advance topic of process control. The coding problems include the sum of factorial number and letter count of a string.
* 作業九 (HW 9): HW 9 is about defining a function in Python. The coding problems include the Prime number determiniation and the summation of an unlimited length of numbers.
* 作業十 (HW 10): HW 10 is about exception. However, there are only question-answers problems and no coding problems (thus there is no code in the file).

There is no file for 作業六 (HW 6) because there are no assignments.
